This interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard was created using Power BI to help business stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit, and profit margin. The dashboard allows users to filter data by region, product category, and time period using slicers, enhancing interactivity and exploration. Key visualizations include KPI cards, bar charts, line charts, and category-wise performance summaries. The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by highlighting trends such as peak sales periods, high-margin regions, and underperforming segments.
